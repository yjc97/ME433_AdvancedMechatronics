## Yujui Chen's Stinky Tofu Recipe:

Stinky tofu is one of the most popular Taiwan cuisine in night market and it might not sound like the most appetising food, but don't be put off by the name! It's true that it does have an intense aroma and a corresponding depth of flavour, but it worth a try!

### Ingredients: 

- 14 oz of firm tofu, cubed 
- 4 tbsp stinky fermented bean curd
- 2 tsp potato starch or 1 tsp cornstarch 
- 2 tsp oyster sauce
- 2 finely chopped cloves of garlic 
- 1 tbsp parsley
- 1 tsp white vinegar
- 1 tsp powdered fennel
- 1 tsp vegetable oil


### Instructions: 

1. Take a large sealable container, such as a tupperware or plastic food storage container with a fitted lid. 
2. In this, mix together the white vinegar, water and stinky fermented bean curd until you have a consistent liquid. 
3. Place your tofu, chopped into chunks of around 1 in square, into the liquid, seal, and refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours. 
   The longer you store it, the stronger the flavour will be. 
4. Remove the tofu chunks from the liquid and drain them thoroughly. 
5. Heat the oil in a wok, and fry your tofu chunks until the surface is golden. Place them to one side on a plate.
6. Now fry the garlic until it becomes fragrant, and then add the oyster sauce, fennel powder and half a cup of water. 
7. Bring it to the boil, then add the tofu chunks back into the wok and simmer for one minute. 
8. Add chopped parsley and serve.
9. Enjoy! Delicious Stinky Tofu!
